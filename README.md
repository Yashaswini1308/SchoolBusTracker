# School Bus Tracker

**School Bus Tracker** is a web-based application that enables real-time tracking of school buses along their routes.  
It features a Node.js backend, a Leaflet.js map interface, and separate admin and student dashboards.  
Admins can manage routes, drivers, attendance, and student information, while students can view bus locations and schedules.  
This project aims to enhance safety and transparency in school transportation.
